# maze_solver
Maze Generator and Solver
This Python project utilizes Pygame to generate and solve mazes. The maze generation is done using a depth-first search algorithm and the maze is solved using a breadth-first search algorithm.

Usage
The program will first generate a maze using a depth-first search algorithm. The process of maze generation will be visualized with different colors:

Dark green: a cell that has been visited.
After the maze is fully generated, you can select the start and end points by clicking on the desired cells:

Red: the selected start and end points.
The program will then solve the maze from the start point to the end point using a breadth-first search algorithm. The path will be visualized in yellow.
